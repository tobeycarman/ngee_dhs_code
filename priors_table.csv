# Priors summary table. Generated 12/10/2020 using scripts
# that collate data from the run directories, and then 
# adjusted using scripts that add the confidence interval, 
# median, and units columns.
#
# Column descriptions:
# pftname = name of the community type (4 = shrub tundra, 5= tussock tundra, 6 = wet sedge tundra , 7 = heath tundra)
# vname = variable name
# units = the units of measurement
# distname = statistical distribution assigend to the parameter range of values, using R distributions
# parama = first parameter of the distribution
# paramb = second parameter of the distribution
# n = the number of samples in the Bety DB for the parameter 
# cimin = lower confidence interval
# cimax = upper confidence interval
# median = median value of the parameter
